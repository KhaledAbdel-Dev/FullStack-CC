Created a full-stack argumentative social media concept. Every user can securely sign up/in to generate a debate prompt. User can update prompts, add and (dis)like messages and delete the board.

This application has all the classic CRUD elements typically found in full-stack applications.


This was created using HTML, CSS, Node.js and some vanilla JavaScript. Express.js was utilized as a template handler with a MongoDB database.
This is commonly referred to as the MERN stack.
